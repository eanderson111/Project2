The Handyman Plan is a simple insurance plan for your handyman needs. Just $20 per month saves you time and money, with an additional peace of mind knowing your cost is fixed with just a small co-pay. In addition, before you schedule a handyman (and pay the $75 co-pay), we allow you to see if there is anyone in your area who might be able to help you.

How does it work?
- You sign up at a low $20/month
- We cover many of the most frequent repairs, installations and assemblies in the house
- You only pay a fixed $75 co-pay for the visit
- We allow you to see if there is anyone in your area who might be able to help you.
